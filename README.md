# pfSenseAPI
pfSense API in C#

This project is still a basic setup and is meant to be able to pull data out of pfSense remotely. The makers of pfSense have announced that the next major release of pfSense, version 3.0, will contain native REST endpoints to communicate with which will make this way easier. For now we're stuck with HTTP Replays and parsing HTML to get the data we need. I'll probably be adding more functionality to this API when time goes by. For now if you can use it, feel free to do so and add your own implementations.

Any questions or feedback is welcome!
